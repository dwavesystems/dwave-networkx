def maximum_clique(G, sampler=None, lagrange=2.0, **sampler_args):
    """
    Returns an approximate maximum clique.
    A clique in an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subset of the vertex set
    `C \subseteq V` such that for every two vertices in C there exists an edge
    connecting the two. This is equivalent to saying that the subgraph
    induced by C is complete (in some cases, the term clique may also refer
    to the subgraph).A maximum clique is a clique of the largest
    possible size in a given graph.

    This function works by finding the maximum independent set of the compliment
    graph of the given graph G which is equivalent to finding maximum clique.
    It defines a QUBO with ground states corresponding
    to a maximum weighted independent set and uses the sampler to sample from it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph on which to find a maximum clique.

    sampler
        A binary quadratic model sampler. A sampler is a process that
        samples from low energy states in models defined by an Ising
        equation or a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
        Problem (QUBO). A sampler is expected to have a 'sample_qubo'
        and 'sample_ising' method. A sampler is expected to return an
        iterable of samples, in order of increasing energy. If no
        sampler is provided, one must be provided using the
        `set_default_sampler` function.

    lagrange : optional (default 2)
        Lagrange parameter to weight constraints (no edges within set)
        versus objective (largest set possible).

    sampler_args
        Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns
    -------
    clique_nodes : list
       List of nodes that form a maximum clique, as
       determined by the given sampler.

    Notes
    -----
    Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
    function does not attempt to confirm the quality of the returned
    sample.

    Returns the number of vertices in the maximum clique of a graph.
    A maximum clique is a clique of the largest possible size in a given graph.
    The clique number `\omega(G)` of a graph G is the number of
    vertices in a maximum clique in G. The intersection number of
    G is the smallest number of cliques that together cover all edges of G.
