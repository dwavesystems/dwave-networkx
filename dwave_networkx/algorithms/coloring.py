def min_vertex_coloring(G, sampler=None, **sampler_args):
    """Returns an approximate minimum vertex coloring.

    Defines a QUBO with ground states corresponding to minimum
    vertex colorings and uses the sampler to sample from it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph on which to find a minimum vertex coloring.

    sampler
        A binary quadratic model sampler. A sampler is a process that
        samples from low energy states in models defined by an Ising
        equation or a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
        Problem (QUBO). A sampler is expected to have a 'sample_qubo'
        and 'sample_ising' method. A sampler is expected to return an
        iterable of samples, in order of increasing energy. If no
        sampler is provided, one must be provided using the
        `set_default_sampler` function.

    sampler_args
        Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns
    -------
    coloring : dict
        A coloring for each vertex in G such that no adjacent nodes
        share the same color. A dict of the form {node: color, ...}

    Example
    -------
    This example colors a single Chimera unit cell. It colors the four
    horizontal qubits one color (0) and the four vertical qubits another (1).

    >>> # Set up a sampler; this example uses a sampler from dimod https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod
    >>> import dimod
    >>> import dwave_networkx as dnx
    >>> samplerSA = dimod.SimulatedAnnealingSampler()
    >>> # Create a graph and color it
    >>> G = dnx.chimera_graph(1, 1, 4)
    >>> colors = dnx.min_vertex_coloring(G, sampler=samplerSA)
    >>> colors
    {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}
