    """Creates a graph using the common nodes and edges of two given graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph0: (dict[adjacency]/:obj:`~networkx.Graph`)
        A NetworkX graph or a dimod sampler adjacency.

    graph1: (dict[adjacency]/:obj:`~networkx.Graph`)
        A NetworkX graph or a dimod sampler adjacency.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        A graph with the nodes and edges common to both input graphs.

    Examples
    ========

    This example creates a graph that represents a quarter (4 by 4 Chimera tiles)
    of a particular D-Wave system's working graph.

    >>> c4_working_graph = common_graph(C4, sampler.adjacency)   # doctest: +SKIP
