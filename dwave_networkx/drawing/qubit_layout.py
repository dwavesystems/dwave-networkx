    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to be drawn

        A dict of coordinates associated with each node in G.  Should

        treated as vectors, and should all have the same length.

    emb : dict
        A dict of chains associated with each node in G.  Should be
        of the form {node: chain, ...}.  Chains should be iterables
        of qubit labels (qubits are nodes in G).

    embedded_graph : NetworkX graph (optional, default None)
        A graph which contains all keys of emb as nodes.  If specified,
        edges of G will be considered interactions if and only if they
        exist between two chains of emb if their keys are connected by
        an edge in embedded_graph

    interaction_edges : list (optional, default None)
        A list of edges which will be used as interactions.

    show_labels: boolean (optional, default False)
        If show_labels is True, then each chain in emb is labelled with its key.

    chain_color : dict (optional, default None)
        A dict of colors associated with each key in emb.  Should be
        of the form {node: rgba_color, ...}.  Colors should be length-4
        tuples of floats between 0 and 1 inclusive. If chain_color is None,
        each chain will be assigned a different color.

    unused_color : tuple (optional, default (0.9,0.9,0.9,1.0))
        The color to use for nodes and edges of G which are not involved
        in chains, and edges which are neither chain edges nor interactions.
        If unused_color is None, these nodes and edges will not be shown at all.
