    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to be drawn

    layout : dict
        A dict of coordinates associated with each node in G.  Should
        be of the form {node: coordinate, ...}.  Coordinates will be
        treated as vectors, and should all have the same length.

    linear_biases : dict (optional, default {})
        A dict of biases associated with each node in G. Should be of
        form {node: bias, ...}. Each bias should be numeric.

    quadratic_biases : dict (optional, default {})
        A dict of biases associated with each edge in G. Should be of
        form {edge: bias, ...}. Each bias should be numeric. Self-loop
        edges (i.e., :math:`i=j`) are treated as linear biases.

    midpoint : float (optional, default None)
        A float that specifies where the center of the colormap should
        be. If not provided, the colormap will default to the middle of
        min/max values provided.

    line_plot : boolean (optional, default False)
        If line_plot is True, then qubits are drawn as line segments, and edges
        are drawn either as line segments between qubits, or as circles where
        two qubits overlap.  In this drawing style, the interpretation the width
        and node_size parameters (provided in kwargs) determines the area of the
        circles, and line widths, respectively.  Qubit line segments are given
        twice the width of edges.  Layout should be a dict of the form
        {node: ((x0, y0), (y0, x0)), ...} -- instead of coordinates, the nodes
        are associated with endpoints of n-dimensional line segments.

    kwargs : optional keywords
       See networkx.draw_networkx() for a description of optional keywords,
       with the exception of the `pos` parameter which is not used by this
       function. If `linear_biases` or `quadratic_biases` are provided,
       any provided `node_color` or `edge_color` arguments are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to be drawn

    layout : dict
        A dict of coordinates associated with each node in G.  Should
        be of the form {node: coordinate, ...}.  Coordinates will be
        treated as vectors, and should all have the same length.

    emb : dict
        A dict of chains associated with each node in G.  Should be
        of the form {node: chain, ...}.  Chains should be iterables
        of qubit labels (qubits are nodes in G).

    embedded_graph : NetworkX graph (optional, default None)
        A graph which contains all keys of emb as nodes.  If specified,
        edges of G will be considered interactions if and only if they
        exist between two chains of emb if their keys are connected by
        an edge in embedded_graph

    interaction_edges : list (optional, default None)
        A list of edges which will be used as interactions.

    show_labels: boolean (optional, default False)
        If show_labels is True, then each chain in emb is labelled with its key.

    chain_color : dict (optional, default None)
        A dict of colors associated with each key in emb.  Should be
        of the form {node: rgba_color, ...}.  Colors should be length-4
        tuples of floats between 0 and 1 inclusive. If chain_color is None,
        each chain will be assigned a different color.

    cmap : str or matplotlib colormap (optional, default None)
        A matplotlib colormap for coloring of chains.  Only used if chain_color
        is None.

    unused_color : tuple or color string (optional, default (0.9,0.9,0.9,1.0))
        The color to use for nodes and edges of G which are not involved
        in chains, and edges which are neither chain edges nor interactions.
        If unused_color is None, these nodes and edges will not be shown at all.

    overlapped_embedding: boolean (optional, default False)
        If overlapped_embedding is True, then chains in emb may overlap (contain
        the same vertices in G), and the drawing will display these overlaps as
        concentric circles.

    line_plot : boolean (optional, default False)
        If line_plot is True, then qubits are drawn as line segments, and edges
        are drawn either as line segments between qubits, or as circles where
        two qubits overlap.  In this drawing style, the interpretation the width
        and node_size parameters (provided in kwargs) determines the area of the
        circles, and line widths, respectively.  Qubit line segments are given
        twice the width of edges.  Layout should be a dict of the form
        {node: ((x0, y0), (y0, x0)), ...} -- instead of coordinates, the nodes
        are associated with endpoints of n-dimensional line segments.

    kwargs : optional keywords
       See networkx.draw_networkx() for a description of optional keywords,
       with the exception of the `pos` parameter which is not used by this
       function. If `linear_biases` or `quadratic_biases` are provided,
       any provided `node_color` or `edge_color` arguments are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to be parsed for faults

    layout : dict
        A dict of coordinates associated with each node in perfect_graph. Should
        be of the form {node: coordinate, ...}.  Coordinates will be
        treated as vectors, and should all have the same length.

    perfect_graph : NetworkX graph
        The graph to be drawn with highlighted faults

    unused_color : tuple or color string (optional, default (0.9,0.9,0.9,1.0))
        The color to use for nodes and edges of G which are not faults.
        If unused_color is None, these nodes and edges will not be shown at all.

    fault_color : tuple or color string (optional, default (1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0))
        A color to represent nodes absent from the graph G, and edges absent
        from the graph G which are not incident to faulty nodes. 

    incident_fault_color : tuple or color string (optional, default (1.0,0.8,0.8,1.0))
        A color to represent edges incident to faulty nodes.  Colors should be
        length-4 tuples of floats between 0 and 1 inclusive.

    fault_shape : string, optional (default='o')
        The shape of the fault nodes. Specification is as matplotlib.scatter
        marker, one of 'so^>v<dph8'.

    fault_style : string, optional (default='dashed')
        Edge fault line style (solid|dashed|dotted,dashdot)

    line_plot : boolean (optional, default False)
        If line_plot is True, then qubits are drawn as line segments, and edges
        are drawn either as line segments between qubits, or as circles where
        two qubits overlap.  In this drawing style, the interpretation the width
        and node_size parameters (provided in kwargs) determines the area of the
        circles, and line widths, respectively.  Qubit line segments are given
        twice the width of edges.  Layout should be a dict of the form
        {node: ((x0, y0), (y0, x0)), ...} -- instead of coordinates, the nodes
        are associated with endpoints of n-dimensional line segments.

    kwargs : optional keywords
       See networkx.draw_networkx() for a description of optional keywords,
       with the exception of the `pos` parameter which is not used by this
       function. If `linear_biases` or `quadratic_biases` are provided,
       any provided `node_color` or `edge_color` arguments are ignored.

          the midpoints of the respective perpendicular projections.

    Parameters
    ----------

    G : networkx.Graph
        A graph constructed by :func:`chimera_layout`, :func:`pegasus_layout`,

    edgelist : iterable or None (default=None)
        The set of edges to draw.  If both nodelist and ``edgelist`` are None,

        subgraph ``G.subgraph(nodelist)`` are drawn.

    node_color : iterable or string (default='blue')
        The sequence of colors to use in drawing nodes of G.  If node_color is
        not a string, the colors are taken in the same order as nodelist, and
        each color is either a float, a 3-tuple or 4-tuple of floats.

    edge_color : iterable or string (default='black')
        The sequence of colors to use in drawing edges of G.  If edge_color is
        not a string, the colors are taken in the same order as ``edgelist``,

    cmap : string or matplotlib.ColorMap or None (default=None)
        A colormap to color nodes with.  Presumes that node_color is a sequence

        A colormap to color edges with.  Presumes that edge_color is a sequence
        of floats.

    edge_vmin : float or None (default=None)
        Minimum value to use to use when normalizing edge colors through
        ``edge_cmap``.

    edge_vmax : float or None (default=None)
        Maximum value to use to use when normalizing edge colors through
        ``edge_cmap``.
    
    z_offset : int (default=0)
        An offset to the "zorder: that various elements are drawn in.  Edge
        lines are drawn with `zorder=z_offset`; horizontal node lines are drawn
        with `zorder=zoffset+1`; vertical node lines are drawn with
        `zorder=zoffset+2`, and edge circles are drawn with `zorder=zoffset+3`.
        This parameter can be used to layer line plots over or under each other.
