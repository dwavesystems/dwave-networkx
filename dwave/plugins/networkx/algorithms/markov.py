                          **sampler_args):
    """Samples from a markov network using the provided sampler.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A Markov Network as returned by :func:`.markov_network`

    sampler
        A binary quadratic model sampler. A sampler is a process that
        samples from low energy states in models defined by an Ising
        equation or a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
        Problem (QUBO). A sampler is expected to have a 'sample_qubo'
        and 'sample_ising' method. A sampler is expected to return an
        iterable of samples, in order of increasing energy. If no
        sampler is provided, one must be provided using the
        `set_default_sampler` function.

    fixed_variables : dict
        A dictionary of variable assignments to be fixed in the markov network.

    return_sampleset : bool (optional, default=False)
        If True, returns a :obj:`dimod.SampleSet` rather than a list of samples.

    **sampler_args
        Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns
    -------
    samples : list[dict]/:obj:`dimod.SampleSet`
        A list of samples ordered from low-to-high energy or a sample set.

    Examples
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
    function does not attempt to confirm the quality of the returned
    sample.
