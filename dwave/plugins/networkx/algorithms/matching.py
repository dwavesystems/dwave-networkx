    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph on which to find a maximal matching.

    sampler
        A binary quadratic model sampler. A sampler is a process that
        samples from low energy states in models defined by an Ising
        equation or a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
        Problem (QUBO). A sampler is expected to have a 'sample_qubo'

        iterable of samples, in order of increasing energy. If no
        sampler is provided, one must be provided using the
        `set_default_sampler` function.

    sampler_args
        Additional keyword parameters are passed to the sampler.

    Returns
    -------
    matching : set
        A maximal matching of the graph.

    -----
    Samplers by their nature may not return the optimal solution. This
