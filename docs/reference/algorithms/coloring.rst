Graph coloring is the problem of assigning a color to the vertices of a graph
in a way that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

Example
-------

The map-coloring problem is to assign a color to each region of a map
(represented by a vertex on a graph) such that any two regions sharing a
border (represented by an edge of the graph) have different colors.
