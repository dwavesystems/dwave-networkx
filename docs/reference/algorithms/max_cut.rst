A maximum cut is a subset of a graph's vertices such that the number of edges
between this subset and the remaining vertices is as large as possible.

   Maximum cut for a Chimera unit cell: the blue line around the subset of nodes
   {4, 5, 6, 7} cuts 16 edges; adding or removing a node decreases
   the number of edges between the two complementary subsets of the graph.
