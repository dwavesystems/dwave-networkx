Elimination Ordering
********************

Many algorithms for NP-hard problems are exponential in treewidth. However,
finding a lower bound on treewidth is in itself NP-complete. [GD]_ describes
a branch-and-bound algorithm for computing the treewidth of an undirected graph
by searching in the space of *perfect elimination ordering* of vertices of
the graph.

A *clique* of a graph is a fully-connected subset of vertices; that is, every
pair of vertices in the clique share an edge. A *simplicial* vertex is one
whose neighborhood induces a clique. A perfect elimination ordering is an
ordering of vertices :math:`1..n` such that any vertex :math:`i` is simplicial
for the subset of vertices :math:`i..n`.
